# OncoVision
OncoVision is a Python ML pipeline for detecting multiple cancers (Breast, Lung, Skin, Brain, Blood, Bone) from medical images. It uses PCA for feature reduction, SVM/RandomForest/KNN with hyperparameter tuning, a soft-voting ensemble for accuracy, plus single-image prediction and visual evaluation via confusion matrices.
